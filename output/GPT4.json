It was prophesied that whoever ate the salmon would gain all the knowledge of the world. Finnegas finally caught the salmon and instructed Fionn to cook it for him. While cooking the fish, Fionn burned his thumb on the salmon's juices and instinctively put it in his mouth to soothe the pain. By doing so, he inadvertently gained the wisdom the salmon possessed.\n\nWhen Finnegas realized what had happened, he gave the entire salmon to Fionn to eat, thus bestowing upon him all the knowledge of the world.

It was originally passed down orally in the prehistoric era. In the early medieval era, some myths were transcribed by Christian monks, who heavily altered and Christianised the myths. Irish mythology is the best-preserved branch of Celtic mythology.\nThe myths are conventionally grouped into 'cycles'. The Mythological Cycle consists of tales and poems about the god-like T\u00faatha D\u00e9 Danann, who are based on Ireland's pagan deities, and other mythical races like the Fomorians. Important works in the cycle are the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn (\"Book of Invasions\"), a legendary history of Ireland, the Cath Maige Tuired (\"Battle of Moytura\"), and the Aided Chlainne Lir (\"Children of Lir\"). The Ulster Cycle consists of heroic legends relating to the Ulaid, the most important of which is the epic T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge (\"Cattle Raid of Cooley\"). The Fianna Cycle focuses on the exploits of the mythical hero Finn and his warrior band the Fianna, including the lengthy Acallam na Sen\u00f3rach (\"Tales of the Elders\"). The Kings' Cycle comprises legends about historical and semi-historical kings of Ireland (such as Buile Shuibhne, \"The Madness of King Sweeny\"), and tales about the origins of dynasties and peoples.There are also mythical texts that do not fit into any of the cycles; these include the echtrai tales of journeys to the Otherworld (such as The Voyage of Bran), and the Dindsenchas (\"lore of places\"). Some written material has not survived, and many more myths were probably never written down.\n\n\n\nPage: Oscar (Irish mythology)\nSummary: Oscar (oscara = \"deer/god friend\") is a figure in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. He is the son of Ois\u00edn (the son of the epic hero Fionn mac Cumhail) and Niamh, and the brother of Plor na mBan and Finn, his bride is called Malvina. Though possibly a later addition to the cycle, Oscar was a popular character, and appeared prominently in several later Fenian tales, serving his grandfather as one of the fianna.\nIn Bruidhean Chaorthainn (Fairy Palace of the Quicken Trees), Oscar swept off the head of Sinsar, the King of the World, in the battle on the ford of the Shannon River.His death is described in the story Cath Gabhra (The Battle of Gabhra), which pits the increasingly corrupt Fianna against the Army of the High King of Ireland, Cairbre Lifechair. Cairbre, aided by defected Fianna warriors loyal to Goll mac Morna, receives his death blow from Oscar, but mortally wounds him with his steel chains as his final act. Oscar's death causes Fionn to weep for the only time in his life, and serves as the final blow to the Fianna's strength.\n\nPage: Celtic mythology\nSummary: Celtic mythology is the body of myths belonging to the Celtic peoples. Like other Iron Age Europeans, Celtic peoples followed a polytheistic religion, having many gods and goddesses. The mythologies of continental Celtic peoples, such as the Gauls and Celtiberians, did not survive their conquest by the Roman Empire, the loss of their Celtic languages and their subsequent conversion to Christianity. Only remnants are found in Greco-Roman sources and archaeology. Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples (the Gaels of Ireland and Scotland; the Celtic Britons of western Britain and Brittany). They preserved some of their myths in oral lore, which were eventually written down by Christian scribes in the Middle Ages. Irish mythology has the largest written body of myths, followed by Welsh mythology.\nThe supernatural race called the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann are believed to be based on the main Celtic gods of Ireland, while many Welsh characters belong either to the Plant D\u00f4n (\"Children of D\u00f4n\") and the Plant Ll\u0177r (\"Children of Ll\u0177r\"). Some figures in Insular Celtic myth have ancient continental parallels: Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu are cognate with Lugus, Goibniu and Gofannon with Gobannos, Mac\u00e1n and Mabon with Maponos, and so on.

Col. Masataka Ida (\u4e95\u7530\u6b63\u5b5d, Ida Masataka) (5 October 1912 \u2013 6 February 2004) was a young Lieutenant Colonel in the Military Affairs Section of the Japanese Ministry of War, at the end of World War II. He had been stationed on Formosa (Taiwan), but was ordered back to Tokyo early in 1945. Along with Major Kenji Hatanaka and a few others, he was one of the chief conspirators in the Ky\u016bj\u014d incident to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Kantar\u014d Suzuki; they wished to see the institution of martial law under War Minister Korechika Anami. The plan changed, however, into a plot, engineered by Major Kenji Hatanaka, to seize the Imperial Palace and prevent the broadcast of the Emperor's surrender speech. Lt. Col. Ida took part in this plot only briefly, trying to talk Hatanaka out of it by the end. Not many know about his attempted 'coup', which, although it failed, came dangerously close to lengthening the war, and altering the face of modern history.\nIda saw the surrender as suicide on the part of the nation as a whole, and as an attempt by the Cabinet members to save their own lives, with no regard for the nation's honor. He decided that the only way for the military to regain its honor, and apologize to the Emperor for being defeated was for them to commit mass suicide by seppuku. Failing that, he intended to commit seppuku himself. Upon being asked by Major Hatanaka, the creator of the plot, to join him, he replied that the plot offered no guarantee of success, and might even lead to a civil war. He refused to join the plot, opting instead to continue his preparations for suicide.\nIda was convinced for a time to help Hatanaka, by asking for support from Lt. Gen. Takeshi Mori of the 1st Imperial Guards Division, and from the Eastern District Army. As he explained his reasoning to Mori, he became more and more passionate about going through with the plot. However, after Mori's refusal to support the uprising, and subsequent murder, and Ida's inability to gain the support of the Eastern District Army, he decided that the plan could never succeed. He went to the Imperial Palace to warn Hatanaka that the Eastern District Army was on their way to stop him, and that he should give up. Ida felt that there was no longer a chance for success, and the only honorable end to it could come from suicide.\nConvinced he had done all he could to dissuade Hatanaka, Ida went to tell War Minister Korechika Anami of the occupation of the Palace. Told that Anami was preparing to commit seppuku, Ida informed the Minister of his intentions to do the same. Anami insisted that he live on, that it was more courageous to work for the rebuilding of Japan than to co"}], "parsing_error": false, "iteration_limit_exceeded": false, "agent_error": null, "start_time": "2024-01-04 09:28:19", "end_time": "2024-01-04 09:28:29", "task": "HotpotQA-hard", "eval_score_GPT4": "5", "eval_feedback_GPT4": "The response provided is completely correct, accurate, and factual.

A recipient of three Academy Awards and three BAFTA Awards, his work has been characterized by a strong connection to fairy tales and horror, with an effort to infuse visual or poetic beauty in the grotesque. He has had a lifelong fascination with monsters, which he considers symbols of great power. He is also known for his use of insectile and religious imagery, his themes of Catholicism, anti-fascism, and celebrating imperfection, underworld motifs, practical special effects, and dominant amber lighting.Throughout his career, del Toro has shifted between Spanish-language films\u2014such as Cronos (1993), The Devil's Backbone (2001), and Pan's Labyrinth (2006)\u2014and English-language films, including Mimic (1997), Blade II (2002), Hellboy (2004) and its sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), Pacific Rim (2013), Crimson Peak (2015), The Shape of Water (2017), Nightmare Alley (2021), and Pinocchio (2022).\nAs a producer or writer, he worked on the films The Orphanage (2007), Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010), The Hobbit film series (2012\u20132014), Mama (2013), The Book of Life (2014), Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018), Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019), and The Witches (2020).

It was originally announced in 2008 with a release in 2013 or 2014. However, it went into development hell. In January 2017, McHale, creator of Over the Garden Wall, was announced to co-write the screenplay, but production was suspended in November 2017 as no studios were willing to provide financing. It was revived the following year after being acquired by Netflix.\nPinocchio premiered at the 66th BFI London Film Festival on October 15, 2022.
