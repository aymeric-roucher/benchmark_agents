It was prophesied that whoever ate the salmon would gain all the knowledge of the world. Finnegas finally caught the salmon and instructed Fionn to cook it for him. While cooking the fish, Fionn burned his thumb on the salmon's juices and instinctively put it in his mouth to soothe the pain. By doing so, he inadvertently gained the wisdom the salmon possessed.\n\nWhen Finnegas realized what had happened, he gave the entire salmon to Fionn to eat, thus bestowing upon him all the knowledge of the world.

It was originally passed down orally in the prehistoric era. In the early medieval era, some myths were transcribed by Christian monks, who heavily altered and Christianised the myths. Irish mythology is the best-preserved branch of Celtic mythology.\nThe myths are conventionally grouped into 'cycles'. The Mythological Cycle consists of tales and poems about the god-like T\u00faatha D\u00e9 Danann, who are based on Ireland's pagan deities, and other mythical races like the Fomorians. Important works in the cycle are the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn (\"Book of Invasions\"), a legendary history of Ireland, the Cath Maige Tuired (\"Battle of Moytura\"), and the Aided Chlainne Lir (\"Children of Lir\"). The Ulster Cycle consists of heroic legends relating to the Ulaid, the most important of which is the epic T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge (\"Cattle Raid of Cooley\"). The Fianna Cycle focuses on the exploits of the mythical hero Finn and his warrior band the Fianna, including the lengthy Acallam na Sen\u00f3rach (\"Tales of the Elders\"). The Kings' Cycle comprises legends about historical and semi-historical kings of Ireland (such as Buile Shuibhne, \"The Madness of King Sweeny\"), and tales about the origins of dynasties and peoples.There are also mythical texts that do not fit into any of the cycles; these include the echtrai tales of journeys to the Otherworld (such as The Voyage of Bran), and the Dindsenchas (\"lore of places\"). Some written material has not survived, and many more myths were probably never written down.\n\n\n\nPage: Oscar (Irish mythology)\nSummary: Oscar (oscara = \"deer/god friend\") is a figure in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. He is the son of Ois\u00edn (the son of the epic hero Fionn mac Cumhail) and Niamh, and the brother of Plor na mBan and Finn, his bride is called Malvina. Though possibly a later addition to the cycle, Oscar was a popular character, and appeared prominently in several later Fenian tales, serving his grandfather as one of the fianna.\nIn Bruidhean Chaorthainn (Fairy Palace of the Quicken Trees), Oscar swept off the head of Sinsar, the King of the World, in the battle on the ford of the Shannon River.His death is described in the story Cath Gabhra (The Battle of Gabhra), which pits the increasingly corrupt Fianna against the Army of the High King of Ireland, Cairbre Lifechair. Cairbre, aided by defected Fianna warriors loyal to Goll mac Morna, receives his death blow from Oscar, but mortally wounds him with his steel chains as his final act. Oscar's death causes Fionn to weep for the only time in his life, and serves as the final blow to the Fianna's strength.\n\nPage: Celtic mythology\nSummary: Celtic mythology is the body of myths belonging to the Celtic peoples. Like other Iron Age Europeans, Celtic peoples followed a polytheistic religion, having many gods and goddesses. The mythologies of continental Celtic peoples, such as the Gauls and Celtiberians, did not survive their conquest by the Roman Empire, the loss of their Celtic languages and their subsequent conversion to Christianity. Only remnants are found in Greco-Roman sources and archaeology. Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples (the Gaels of Ireland and Scotland; the Celtic Britons of western Britain and Brittany). They preserved some of their myths in oral lore, which were eventually written down by Christian scribes in the Middle Ages. Irish mythology has the largest written body of myths, followed by Welsh mythology.\nThe supernatural race called the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann are believed to be based on the main Celtic gods of Ireland, while many Welsh characters belong either to the Plant D\u00f4n (\"Children of D\u00f4n\") and the Plant Ll\u0177r (\"Children of Ll\u0177r\"). Some figures in Insular Celtic myth have ancient continental parallels: Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu are cognate with Lugus, Goibniu and Gofannon with Gobannos, Mac\u00e1n and Mabon with Maponos, and so on.

Col. Masataka Ida (\u4e95\u7530\u6b63\u5b5d, Ida Masataka) (5 October 1912 \u2013 6 February 2004) was a young Lieutenant Colonel in the Military Affairs Section of the Japanese Ministry of War, at the end of World War II. He had been stationed on Formosa (Taiwan), but was ordered back to Tokyo early in 1945. Along with Major Kenji Hatanaka and a few others, he was one of the chief conspirators in the Ky\u016bj\u014d incident to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Kantar\u014d Suzuki; they wished to see the institution of martial law under War Minister Korechika Anami. The plan changed, however, into a plot, engineered by Major Kenji Hatanaka, to seize the Imperial Palace and prevent the broadcast of the Emperor's surrender speech. Lt. Col. Ida took part in this plot only briefly, trying to talk Hatanaka out of it by the end. Not many know about his attempted 'coup', which, although it failed, came dangerously close to lengthening the war, and altering the face of modern history.\nIda saw the surrender as suicide on the part of the nation as a whole, and as an attempt by the Cabinet members to save their own lives, with no regard for the nation's honor. He decided that the only way for the military to regain its honor, and apologize to the Emperor for being defeated was for them to commit mass suicide by seppuku. Failing that, he intended to commit seppuku himself. Upon being asked by Major Hatanaka, the creator of the plot, to join him, he replied that the plot offered no guarantee of success, and might even lead to a civil war. He refused to join the plot, opting instead to continue his preparations for suicide.\nIda was convinced for a time to help Hatanaka, by asking for support from Lt. Gen. Takeshi Mori of the 1st Imperial Guards Division, and from the Eastern District Army. As he explained his reasoning to Mori, he became more and more passionate about going through with the plot. However, after Mori's refusal to support the uprising, and subsequent murder, and Ida's inability to gain the support of the Eastern District Army, he decided that the plan could never succeed. He went to the Imperial Palace to warn Hatanaka that the Eastern District Army was on their way to stop him, and that he should give up. Ida felt that there was no longer a chance for success, and the only honorable end to it could come from suicide.\nConvinced he had done all he could to dissuade Hatanaka, Ida went to tell War Minister Korechika Anami of the occupation of the Palace. Told that Anami was preparing to commit seppuku, Ida informed the Minister of his intentions to do the same. Anami insisted that he live on, that it was more courageous to work for the rebuilding of Japan than to co"}], "parsing_error": false, "iteration_limit_exceeded": false, "agent_error": null, "start_time": "2024-01-04 09:28:19", "end_time": "2024-01-04 09:28:29", "task": "HotpotQA-hard", "eval_score_GPT4": "5", "eval_feedback_GPT4": "The response provided is completely correct, accurate, and factual.

A recipient of three Academy Awards and three BAFTA Awards, his work has been characterized by a strong connection to fairy tales and horror, with an effort to infuse visual or poetic beauty in the grotesque. He has had a lifelong fascination with monsters, which he considers symbols of great power. He is also known for his use of insectile and religious imagery, his themes of Catholicism, anti-fascism, and celebrating imperfection, underworld motifs, practical special effects, and dominant amber lighting.Throughout his career, del Toro has shifted between Spanish-language films\u2014such as Cronos (1993), The Devil's Backbone (2001), and Pan's Labyrinth (2006)\u2014and English-language films, including Mimic (1997), Blade II (2002), Hellboy (2004) and its sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), Pacific Rim (2013), Crimson Peak (2015), The Shape of Water (2017), Nightmare Alley (2021), and Pinocchio (2022).\nAs a producer or writer, he worked on the films The Orphanage (2007), Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010), The Hobbit film series (2012\u20132014), Mama (2013), The Book of Life (2014), Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018), Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019), and The Witches (2020).

It was originally announced in 2008 with a release in 2013 or 2014. However, it went into development hell. In January 2017, McHale, creator of Over the Garden Wall, was announced to co-write the screenplay, but production was suspended in November 2017 as no studios were willing to provide financing. It was revived the following year after being acquired by Netflix.\nPinocchio premiered at the 66th BFI London Film Festival on October 15, 2022.

In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.", "gt_answer": "3", "prediction": "This riddle is a probability puzzle that requires understanding the mechanics of the game and the pattern that emerges from the pistons firing. Let's analyze the possible outcomes after each piston fires:\n\n1. If the first piston fires, the ball in the first position is ejected, and the balls in the second and third positions move up one space. The next ball on the ramp moves into the third position.\n2. If the second piston fires, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position is ejected, the ball in the third position moves to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp move into the second and third positions.\n3. If the third piston fires, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position is ejected, the ball in the second position moves to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp move into the second and third positions.\n\nThe key to solving this riddle is to notice that the ball in the first position will always be released and roll away if either the second or third piston fires. This means that the ball in the first position has a 2/3 chance of being released in each round, while the balls in the second and third positions have a 1/3 chance of being ejected.\n\nGiven this, we can deduce that the ball that starts in the second position will have the highest probability of being ejected because it will only be ejected if the second piston fires, but it will move to the first position (and thus be safe from ejection) if the third piston fires. The ball in the third position will be ejected if the third piston fires and will move to the second position (and potentially be ejected in the next round) if the second piston fires.\n\nTherefore, the ball that starts in the second position on the platform will have the highest probability of being ejected. Since the balls start in ascending order from 1 to 100, and the first three balls are 1, 2, and 3, the ball in the second position is number 2.\n\nTo maximize your odds of winning the big prize, you should choose ball number 2.", "intermediate_steps": [], "parsing_error": false, "iteration_limit_exceeded": false, "agent_error": null, "start_time": "2024-01-19 17:02:01", "end_time": "2024-01-19 17:02:37", "task": "GAIA", "eval_score_GPT4": "1", "eval_feedback_GPT4": "Feedback: The response provided a detailed analysis of the game mechanics and the probabilities associated with each piston firing.

A Count of Moldova, La\u021bcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u0218irnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u0218irnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u0218irnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u0218irnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u0218irnea have been turned into vampires?", "gt_answer": "100", "prediction": "The key to solving this riddle lies in the fact that humans always tell the truth and vampires always lie. If there were any humans in the village, they would tell the truth about the number of vampires in the village. However, since every single resident gives the same answer, \"At least one of us is a human,\" this creates a logical paradox if there were any humans among them.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If there were one or more humans in the village, at least one of them would truthfully say the exact number of vampires in the village. For example, if there were 99 vampires and 1 human, the human would say, \"There are 99 vampires in the village,\" because that's the truth.\n\n2. Since vampires always lie, they would never accurately state the number of vampires in the village. They would give a false number.\n\n3. The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is a cleverly constructed lie that could only be universally given by vampires. If there were any humans, the statement would not hold true universally, as the human(s) would provide the true number of vampires.\n\nSince every resident gives the statement that implies there is at least one human among them, and this statement is given by all 100 residents, it must be a lie told by vampires. If there were any humans, the answers would vary, and at least the human(s) would give a different, truthful answer.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that all 100 residents of \u0218irnea have been turned into vampires.", "intermediate_steps": [], "parsing_error": false, "iteration_limit_exceeded": false, "agent_error": null, "start_time": "2024-01-19 17:10:07", "end_time": "2024-01-19 17:10:19", "task": "GAIA", "eval_score_GPT4": "5", "eval_feedback_GPT4": "Feedback: The response provided is completely correct, accurate, and factual.

The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\n\nIf Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?", "gt_answer": "16000", "prediction": "To determine the optimal strategy for Bob, we need to consider the constraints given by the game:\n\n1. One box must contain at least 2 coins.\n2. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.\n3. There are 30 coins in total.\n\nLet's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as A, B, and C, where A \u2264 B \u2264 C. We know that C = B + 6 or C = A + 6.\n\nSince Bob wants to guarantee the minimum amount of money he can win, he should guess in such a way that he is sure to get some coins from each box. To do this, he should guess the minimum possible number of coins that could be in each box, given the constraints.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for Bob would be if the coins are distributed in such a way that two boxes have the minimum number of coins (2 in one box and 8 in another, since one must have 6 more than the other), leaving the third box with the remaining coins.\n\nLet's calculate the distribution of coins in the worst-case scenario:\n\n- Box A: 2 coins (minimum required)\n- Box B: 8 coins (6 more than Box A)\n- Box C: 30 - (2 + 8) = 20 coins (the remaining coins)\n\nBob should guess 2 for Box A, 8 for Box B, and 20 for Box C to ensure he wins coins from each box. This way, no matter how the boxes are shuffled, he will always win at least the number of coins he guessed.\n\nNow let's calculate the minimum amount of money Bob can win using this strategy:\n\n- From Box A: 2 coins * $1,000 = $2,000\n- From Box B: 8 coins * $1,000 = $8,000\n- From Box C: 20 coins * $1,000 = $20,000\n\nAdding these amounts together gives us the minimum amount of money Bob can win:\n\n$2,000 + $8,000 + $20,000 = $30,000\n\nTherefore, using the optimal strategy, the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game is $30,000.", "intermediate_steps": [], "parsing_error": false, "iteration_limit_exceeded": false, "agent_error": null, "start_time": "2024-01-19 17:10:44", "end_time": "2024-01-19 17:11:01", "task": "GAIA", "eval_score_GPT4": "1", "eval_feedback_GPT4": "Feedback: The response provided is incorrect based on the reference answer and the rules of the game.

By guessing 0, 6, and 24, Bob would be guaranteed to win at least 6 coins from the second box and 24 from the third, totaling 30 coins or $30,000.
