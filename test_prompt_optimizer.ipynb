Let's call the number of cats x, then the number of snakes would be x + 6.\\n\\n2. Frankie has one less parrot than cats. Let's call the number of parrots y, then the number of parrots would be x - 1.\\n\\n3. Six of his pets have four legs. We know that dogs and cats have four legs each, so we can assume that all six snakes have four legs too. So the total number of legs from these six pets is 24 (6 snakes x 4 legs per snake).\\n\\n4. Frankie has 2 dogs. Let's call the number of dogs d, then d = 2.\\n\\n5. Now, let's sum up all the pets and legs:\\n\\n   - Cats: x\\n   - Snakes: x + 6\\n   - Parrots: x - 1\\n   - Dogs: 2\\n   - Total pets: x + x + 6 + 2 = 9\\n   - Total legs from cats, snakes, and dogs: 4x + 24\\n\\n6. Since we know the total number of legs and pets, we can find the number of cats using the system of equations:\\n\\n   4x + 24 = 9x\\n   5x = 24\\n   x = 48 / 5 = 192 / 24\\n   x = 8\\n\\n7. With the number of cats, we can find the number of parrots, snakes, and total pets:\\n\\n   - Cats: 8\\n   - Snakes: 8 + 6 = 14\\n   - Parrots: 8 - 1 = 7\\n   - Total pets: 8 + 8 + 6 + 2 = 20\\n\\n8. Therefore, Frankie has a total of 20 pets, which means that the answer is 200 (the number of legs divided by the number of pets). The answer is 100 legs per pet.

Let's call the number of cars the uncle gave Olaf \"x\". Then, Grandpa gave Olaf 2x cars.\\n- Dad gave Olaf 10 cars, 5 less than Mum. Let's say Mum gave Olaf y cars. Then, Dad gave Olaf 10 cars, which is 5 less than y. This means Dad gave Olaf y-5 cars.\\n- Auntie gave Olaf 6 cars, 1 more than the uncle. Again, let's call the number of cars the uncle gave Olaf \"x\". Then, Auntie gave Olaf 6 cars, which is 1 more than 2x.

Frankie has six more snakes than he has cats. Let's call the number of cats x, then the number of snakes would be x + 6.\\n\\n2. Frankie has one less parrot than cats. Let's call the number of parrots y, then the number of parrots would be x - 1.\\n\\n3. Six of his pets have four legs. We know that dogs and cats have four legs each, so we can assume that all six snakes have four legs too. So the total number of legs from these six pets is 24 (6 snakes x 4 legs per snake).\\n\\n4. Frankie has 2 dogs. Let's call the number of dogs d, then d = 2.\\n\\n5. Now, let's sum up all the pets and legs:\\n\\n   - Cats: x\\n   - Snakes: x + 6\\n   - Parrots: x - 1\\n   - Dogs: 2\\n   - Total pets: x + x + 6 + 2 = 9\\n   - Total legs from cats, snakes, and dogs: 4x + 24\\n\\n6. Since we know the total number of legs and pets, we can find the number of cats using the system of equations:\\n\\n   4x + 24 = 9x\\n   5x = 24\\n   x = 48 / 5 = 192 / 24\\n   x = 8\\n\\n7. With the number of cats, we can find the number of parrots, snakes, and total pets:\\n\\n   - Cats: 8\\n   - Snakes: 8 + 6 = 14\\n   - Parrots: 8 - 1 = 7\\n   - Total pets: 8 + 8 + 6 + 2 = 20\\n\\n8. Therefore, Frankie has a total of 20 pets, which means that the answer is 200 (the number of legs divided by the number of pets). The answer is 100 legs per pet. Since we want to give the final answer in a specific format, let's say \"The answer is                 100.0                  False\n",

Let's break down the calculations:\\n\\n- First, we have Olaf's original collection of 150 cars.\\n- Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many cars as the uncle. Let's call the number of cars the uncle gave Olaf \"x\". Then, Grandpa gave Olaf 2x cars.\\n- Dad gave Olaf 10 cars, 5 less than Mum. Let's say Mum gave Olaf y cars. Then, Dad gave Olaf 10 cars, which is 5 less than y. This means Dad gave Olaf y-5 cars.\\n- Auntie gave Olaf 6 cars, 1 more than the uncle. Again, let's call the number of cars the uncle gave Olaf \"x\". Then, Auntie gave Olaf 6 cars, which is 1 more than 2x. This simplifies to Auntie giving Olaf (2x+1) cars.\\n- Now we have all the information we need to find how many cars Olaf has in total. His original collection of 150 cars, plus the cars he received from his family, gives us:\\n   - Olaf's original collection: 150 cars\\n   - Grandpa gave Olaf 2x cars\\n   - Dad gave Olaf (y-5) cars\\n   - Auntie gave Olaf (2x+1) cars\\n- Let's put these together:\\n   - Olaf's total collection = 150 + 2x + y - 5 + 2x + 1\\n   - Simplifying this expression:\\n      - 4x + y = 234\\n- We don't know the exact values of x and y, but we can find them using some algebraic manipulation. We want to isolate y, so we subtract 4x from both sides:\\n   - y - 4x = 234 - 4x\\n- Next, we want to isolate x, so we divide both sides by 2:\\n   - (y - 4x)/2 = 117 - 2x\\n- Now we have an expression with only x and y. Let's call this expression \"E\".\\n- To find y, we can substitute any value for x and calculate E. For                   0.0                  False\n",

       "      <td>To find the number of pets Frankie has, we need to first find the number of cats he has. Let's call that x. Then, we know he has six more snakes than x, which gives us 6 more snakes than x snakes. Let's call that number y. So, we can write the equation for snakes as:\\n\\ny = 6 + x\\n\\nNext, we know he has one less parrot than x cats. Let's call the number of parrots p. So, we can write the equation for parrots as:\\n\\np = x - 1\\n\\nNow, we know that six of his pets have four legs. Since there are two types of pets with four legs, cats and dogs, let's call the number of cats with four legs c. Since Frankie has two dogs, we know that there are (x - c) - 2 = (x - 2) - c cats with four legs. So, we can write the equation for cats with four legs as:\\n\\nc = (x - 2) - (x - c)\\n\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n\\nc = 2 - c\\n\\nLet's solve this equation for c. If c is the number of cats with four legs, then 2 - c is the number of cats without four legs. We can find the number of cats without four legs by subtracting the number of cats with four legs from the total number of cats. Let's call the total number of cats n. So, we can write:\\n\\nn - c = x - c\\n\\nNow, we have two equations with two unknowns, x and c. Let's solve for x and c.\\n\\nFirst, let's find c. Substituting the expression for c from the equation c = 2 - c into the equation n - c = x - c, we get:\\n\\nn - (2 - c) = x - (2 - c)\\n\\nExpanding, we get:\\n\\nn - 2 + c = x - 2 + c\\n\\nSubtracting c from both sides, we get:\\n\\nn - 2 = x - 2\\n\\nSo, x and n are equal, which means the total number of cats is the same as the total number of pets. Now, we have the equation:</td>\n",

We know that the second stack is 3 blocks taller than the first stack, which is 7 blocks tall. So, the second stack is 10 blocks tall (7 + 3).\\n\\nThe third stack is 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, so its height is the height of the second stack minus 6 blocks.

Let's call that x. Then, we know he has six more snakes than x, which gives us 6 more snakes than x snakes. Let's call that number y. So, we can write the equation for snakes as:\\n\\ny = 6 + x\\n\\nNext, we know he has one less parrot than x cats. Let's call the number of parrots p. So, we can write the equation for parrots as:\\n\\np = x - 1\\n\\nNow, we know that six of his pets have four legs. Since there are two types of pets with four legs, cats and dogs, let's call the number of cats with four legs c. Since Frankie has two dogs, we know that there are (x - c) - 2 = (x - 2) - c cats with four legs. So, we can write the equation for cats with four legs as:\\n\\nc = (x - 2) - (x - c)\\n\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n\\nc = 2 - c\\n\\nLet's solve this equation for c. If c is the number of cats with four legs, then 2 - c is the number of cats without four legs. We can find the number of cats without four legs by subtracting the number of cats with four legs from the total number of cats. Let's call the total number of cats n. So, we can write:\\n\\nn - c = x - c\\n\\nNow, we have two equations with two unknowns, x and c. Let's solve for x and c.\\n\\nFirst, let's find c. Substituting the expression for c from the equation c = 2 - c into the equation n - c = x - c, we get:\\n\\nn - (2 - c) = x - (2 - c)\\n\\nExpanding, we get:\\n\\nn - 2 + c = x - 2 + c\\n\\nSubtracting c from both sides, we get:\\n\\nn - 2 = x - 2\\n\\nSo, x and n are equal, which means the total number of cats is the same as the total number of pets. Now, we have the equation:                  2.00                  False\n",

Since we don't know how many cars Mum gave, let's call that \"y\". This means that Dad gave Olaf 10 cars and Mum gave Olaf y-5 cars.\\n\\nGrandpa gave Olaf twice as many cars as the uncle.

Let's use the fact that at the beginning, Olaf had 150 cars. We can write that as:\\n\\n150 = x + (x+1) + 10 + (y-5) + 2x\\n\\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\\n\\n150 = 3x + y\\n\\nNow, let's find the number of cars Olaf received from each person.\\n\\nUncle: x = ?\\nAuntie: x+1 = ?\\nDad: y-5 = 10\\nMum: y = ?\\nGrandpa: 2x = ?\\n\\nTo find                  0.00                  False\n",

The total width of the pebbles' splashes is:\\n\\n6 pebbles x 1/4 meter = 0.75 meters\\n\\nRock splashes: TreQuan throws 3 rocks, each of which makes a splash that is 1/2 meter wide. The total width of the rocks' splashes is:\\n\\n3 rocks x 1/2 meter = 0.5 meters\\n\\nBoulder splashes: TreQuan throws 2 boulders, each of which makes a splash that is 2 meters wide. The total width of the boulders' splashes is:\\n\\n2 boulders x 2 meters = 4 meters\\n\\nAdding up the widths of the splashes from all the stones, we get:\\n\\n0.75 meters (pebbles) + 0.5 meters (rocks) + 4 meters (boulders) = 5.25 meters\\n\\nSo the total width of the splashes TreQuan creates is approximately 5 meters and 25 centimeters (rounded to two decimal places).\\n\\nIn summary, the answer is:\\n\\nThe total width of the splashes TreQuan creates is 5.25 meters.                  5.25                  False\n",

       "9     To find the number of blocks Thomas used in total, we need to find the height of the fifth stack and the number of blocks in the second stack, as we were given that the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack.\\n\\nLet's start by finding the height of the second stack. We know that the second stack is 3 blocks taller than the first stack, which is 7 blocks tall. So, the second stack is 10 blocks tall (7 + 3).\\n\\nThe third stack is 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, so its height is the height of the second stack minus 6 blocks. Therefore, the third stack is 4 blocks tall (10 - 6).\\n\\nThe fourth stack is 10 blocks taller than the third stack, so its height is the height of the third stack plus 10 blocks. Therefore, the fourth stack is 14 blocks tall (4 + 10).\\n\\nNow, we have all the necessary information to find the height of the fifth stack. We know that the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, and the second stack has 10 blocks. So, the fifth stack has 20 blocks. Since each block is 1 unit tall, the height of the fifth stack is 20 units.\\n\\nTo summarize, the height of the fifth stack is 20 blocks tall. Let's call this height H.\\n\\nLet's find the number of blocks in the second stack. Since the second stack is 10 blocks tall and each block is 1 unit tall, the number of blocks in the second stack is 10. Let's call this number B.\\n\\nNow, we can find the total number of blocks Thomas used by adding up the number of blocks in all the stacks.

Here's how I got it:\\n\\nLet's call the score of the third dart x.\\n\\nDon's scores are:\\n- Bullseye (50 points)\\n- Missed the target (0 points)\\n- Third dart worth half of 50 points (25 * x)\\n\\nTotal score: 50 + 0 + 25 * x = 75 * x / 4\\n\\nSince we know that the final score is 75, we can set up an equation:\\n\\n75 = 75 * x / 4\\n\\nSimplifying:\\n\\nx = 3\\n\\nSo the final score from these 3 throws is 150 (50 for the bullseye, 0 for the missed dart, and 100 for the third dart, which was worth half the points of the bullseye). However, since we're calculating Don's total score, we need to divide the score from the third dart by 4, since it was worth only half the points of the bullseye. This gives us the answer of 75 points.\\n\\nThe answer is 75.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The answer is: Each person gets 9 omelets.\\n\\nExplanation:\\n\\nNumber of eggs = 3 dozen = 360\\nNumber of eggs used in each omelet = 4\\nNumber of omelets that can be made with all the eggs = 360 / 4 = 90\\nNumber of omelets for Pauly = 90 / 3 = 30 (Pauly is also a person)\\nNumber of omelets for other 2 people = (90 - 30) / 2 = 45 / 2 = 22.5 (rounded down to 22)\\nNumber of omelets for each of the other 2 people = 22\\n\\nTotal omelets = 30 + 22 = 52\\n\\nSince we're given that there are 3 people, each person gets:\\n\\nNumber of omelets for each person = Total omelets / Number of people = 52 / 3 = 17.33 (rounded down to 17)\\n\\nBut since we can't have fractional omelets, we round it down to 17. So, each person gets exactly 17 omelets. However, we can simplify this calculation further by finding the number of omelets per person directly. The number of omelets per person is the total number of omelets divided by the number of people, which we already calculated as 52 / 3 = 17.33 (rounded down to 17). So, each person gets exactly 17 omelets. Therefore, the answer is: Each person gets 17 omelets, but we simplified the calculation to 9 omelets per person, since each omelet requires 4 eggs, and there are 3 people and 3 dozen eggs.</td>\n",

So he hiked 25 kilometers on the second day.\\nTo find the distance he hiked on the third day, we need to find out how far he has left to go. After two days, he has already hiked a total of 35 kilometers (10 kilometers on the first day and 25 kilometers on the second day). The remaining distance is the full hike distance of 50 kilometers, minus the distance he's already covered: 50 kilometers - 35 kilometers = 15 kilometers.\\nSo on the third day, Ezekiel had to hike 15 kilometers to finish the hike.\\nThe answer is 30 kilometers, which is the sum of the distance he's already covered (35 kilometers) and the remaining distance (15 kilometers): 35 kilometers + 15 kilometers = 50 kilometers, which is the full hike distance.                  50.0                  False\n",

So, each person gets exactly 17 omelets. However, we can simplify this calculation further by finding the number of omelets per person directly. The number of omelets per person is the total number of omelets divided by the number of people, which we already calculated as 52 / 3 = 17.33 (rounded down to 17). So, each person gets exactly 17 omelets. Therefore, the answer is: Each person gets 17 omelets, but we simplified the calculation to 9 omelets per person, since each omelet requires 4 eggs, and there are 3 people and 3 dozen eggs.                   3.0                   True\n",

Here is your math problem:\\n- Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?\\n\\nFirst, let's find the number of cats Frankie has. We know he has six more snakes than cats, and we can represent this as Snakes - Cats = 6. Let's rearrange this to find Cats: Cats = Snakes - 6. Next, we know he has one less parrot than cats. Let's call the number of parrots P. We can represent this as P = Cats - 1. Now, we know that six of Frankie's pets have four legs. We'll call the number of these pets with four legs F4. We can represent this as F4 = 6. Finally, we know Frankie has two dogs. Let's call the number of dogs D. We can represent this as D = 2.\\n\\nLet's create a table to organize all our information:\\n\\n| Pet type | Number of pets |\\n| Cats | Cats = Snakes - 6 |\\n| Parrots | P = Cats - 1 |\\n| Pets with 4 legs | F4 = 6 |\\n| Dogs | D = 2 |\\n\\nNow, let's find the total number of pets Frankie has. We can add up all the numbers in our table:\\n\\nPets = Cats + P + F4 + D\\n\\nUsing our equations from above, we can substitute in our variables:\\n\\nPets = Snakes - 6 + Cats - 1 + 6 + 2\\n\\nSimplifying:\\n\\nPets = Snakes + Cats + 2\\n\\nLet's substitute in our equation for Cats:\\n\\nPets = Snakes + (Snakes - 6) + 2\\n\\nNow, we can simplify again:\\n\\nPets = Snakes + Sn                   2.0                  False\n",

Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, a total of Y shells. How many seashells did Leigh have?\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the number of shells that Mimi picked up, which is 24. Next, we know that Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so we can set up an equation:\\n\\nX = 2 * 24 = 48\\n\\nNow that we know how many shells Kyle found, we can find how many shells Leigh had. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, so we can set up another equation:\\n\\nY = (1/3) * X\\n\\nSubstituting X = 48 into the second equation, we get:\\n\\nY = (1/3) * 48 = 16\\n\\nSo the total number of seashells is the sum of the number of shells that Mimi, Kyle, and Leigh had:\\n\\nTotal = 24 + 48 - 16 = 48\\n\\nPutting it all together, we have:\\n\\n- Mimi had 24 seashells.\\n- Kyle had 48 seashells.\\n- Leigh had 16 seashells.\\n- The total number of seashells is 48.\\n\\nAnswer: The answer is 48.'</td>\n",

How many pets does he have in total?\\n\\nTo find the total number of pets, we need to calculate the number of cats, then add the number of snakes, the number of parrots, and the number of pets with 4 legs (which is equal to 6 times the number of pets with 4 legs), and finally, add the number of dogs. Let's start by finding the number of cats:\\n\\nFrankie has 6 more snakes than he has cats. Let's call the number of cats x. Then, the number of snakes is x + 6. Frankie's parents also have 1 less parrot than cats, so the number of parrots is x - 1. Here's a summary of the information we have:\\n\\nNumber of snakes: x + 6\\nNumber of parrots: x - 1\\nNumber of pets with 4 legs: 6x\\nNumber of dogs: 2\\n\\nWe can't find the total number of pets yet because we don't know the value of x. Let's add up the number of snakes, parrots, pets with 4 legs, and dogs:\\n\\nNumber of pets = x + 6 + (x - 1) + 6x + 2\\n\\nNow we have an equation with x as the unknown variable. Let's simplify it:\\n\\nNumber of pets = 7x - 1\\n\\nTo find the total number of pets, we need to find the value of x. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to do that, because we don't know how many legs each cat has. Without that information, we can't calculate x. So, we can't find the total number of pets.\\n\\nThe answer is: \"The number of pets</td>\n",

Here is the math problem for you:\\n\\nEzekiel went on a three-day hike last summer. He covered 10 kilometers on the first day and half of the full hike distance on the second day. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to complete the 50-kilometer hike?\\n\\nTo find the number of kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day, we need to determine how far he has already hiked by the end of the second day. He covered 10 kilometers on the first day, so he has already hiked 10 kilometers. On the second day, he hiked half of the remaining distance. Let's call the total distance of the hike \"D\". Since Ezekiel hiked half of the remaining distance on the second day, we can write this as:\\n\\nhalf of D - 10 = Ezekiel's distance on the second day\\n\\nwhere \"10\" is the distance Ezekiel hiked on the first day. We can rearrange this equation to find the value of \"D\":\\n\\nD = 2 * (half of D - 10) + 10\\n\\nD = half of D - 10\\n\\nD = half of D\\n\\nD = 2D\\n\\nD = 4D\\n\\nD = 0\\n\\nThis is a contradiction, as we can't have a distance of zero for a 50-kilometer hike. This means that our original equation is incorrect. We need to rethink our approach.\\n\\nLet's say that Ezekiel covered a distance of \"d\" on the second day. Then, we can write the equation for his second-day distance as:\\n\\nd = half of D - 10\\n\\nwhere \"D\" is the total distance of the hike.

Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, a total of Y shells. How many seashells did Leigh have?\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the number of shells that Mimi picked up, which is 24. Next, we know that Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so we can set up an equation:\\n\\nX = 2 * 24 = 48\\n\\nNow that we know how many shells Kyle found, we can find how many shells Leigh had. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, so we can set up another equation:\\n\\nY = (1/3) * X\\n\\nSubstituting X = 48 into the second equation, we get:\\n\\nY = (1/3) * 48 = 16\\n\\nSo the total number of seashells is the sum of the number of shells that Mimi, Kyle, and Leigh had:\\n\\nTotal = 24 + 48 - 16 = 48\\n\\nPutting it all together, we have:\\n\\n- Mimi had 24 seashells.\\n- Kyle had 48 seashells.\\n- Leigh had 16 seashells.\\n- The total number of seashells is 48.\\n\\nAnswer: The answer is 48.'                  48.0                  False\n",

It's important to perform each calculation step as required by the problem and avoid introducing any steps or information not directly relevant to finding the solution. Here is the math problem for you:\\n\\n- Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has 6 more snakes than he has cats. He has 1 less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have 4 legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?\\n\\nTo find the total number of pets, we need to calculate the number of cats, then add the number of snakes, the number of parrots, and the number of pets with 4 legs (which is equal to 6 times the number of pets with 4 legs), and finally, add the number of dogs. Let's start by finding the number of cats:\\n\\nFrankie has 6 more snakes than he has cats. Let's call the number of cats x. Then, the number of snakes is x + 6. Frankie's parents also have 1 less parrot than cats, so the number of parrots is x - 1. Here's a summary of the information we have:\\n\\nNumber of snakes: x + 6\\nNumber of parrots: x - 1\\nNumber of pets with 4 legs: 6x\\nNumber of dogs: 2\\n\\nWe can't find the total number of pets yet because we don't know the value of x. Let's add up the number of snakes, parrots, pets with 4 legs, and dogs:\\n\\nNumber of pets = x + 6 + (x - 1) + 6x + 2\\n\\nNow we have an equation with x as the unknown variable. Let's simplify it:\\n\\nNumber of pets = 7x - 1\\n\\nTo find the total number of pets, we need to find the value of x. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to do that, because we don't know how many legs each cat has. Without that information, we can't calculate x. So, we can't find the total number of pets.\\n\\nThe answer is: \"The number of pets                   1.0                  False\n",

Here is the math problem for you:\\n\\nEzekiel went on a three-day hike last summer. He covered 10 kilometers on the first day and half of the full hike distance on the second day. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to complete the 50-kilometer hike?\\n\\nTo find the number of kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day, we need to determine how far he has already hiked by the end of the second day. He covered 10 kilometers on the first day, so he has already hiked 10 kilometers. On the second day, he hiked half of the remaining distance. Let's call the total distance of the hike \"D\". Since Ezekiel hiked half of the remaining distance on the second day, we can write this as:\\n\\nhalf of D - 10 = Ezekiel's distance on the second day\\n\\nwhere \"10\" is the distance Ezekiel hiked on the first day. We can rearrange this equation to find the value of \"D\":\\n\\nD = 2 * (half of D - 10) + 10\\n\\nD = half of D - 10\\n\\nD = half of D\\n\\nD = 2D\\n\\nD = 4D\\n\\nD = 0\\n\\nThis is a contradiction, as we can't have a distance of zero for a 50-kilometer hike. This means that our original equation is incorrect. We need to rethink our approach.\\n\\nLet's say that Ezekiel covered a distance of \"d\" on the second day. Then, we can write the equation for his second-day distance as:\\n\\nd = half of D - 10\\n\\nwhere \"D\" is the total distance of the hike.

Frankie has six more snakes than he has cats. Let's call the number of cats x, then the number of snakes would be x + 6.\\n\\n2. Frankie has one less parrot than cats. Let's call the number of parrots y, then the number of parrots would be x - 1.\\n\\n3. Six of his pets have four legs. We know that dogs and cats have four legs each, so we can assume that all six snakes have four legs too. So the total number of legs from these six pets is 24 (6 snakes x 4 legs per snake).\\n\\n4. Frankie has 2 dogs. Let's call the number of dogs d, then d = 2.\\n\\n5. Now, let's sum up all the pets and legs:\\n\\n   - Cats: x\\n   - Snakes: x + 6\\n   - Parrots: x - 1\\n   - Dogs: 2\\n   - Total pets: x + x + 6 + 2 = 9\\n   - Total legs from cats, snakes, and dogs: 4x + 24\\n\\n6. Since we know the total number of legs and pets, we can find the number of cats using the system of equations:\\n\\n   4x + 24 = 9x\\n   5x = 24\\n   x = 48 / 5 = 192 / 24\\n   x = 8\\n\\n7. With the number of cats, we can find the number of parrots, snakes, and total pets:\\n\\n   - Cats: 8\\n   - Snakes: 8 + 6 = 14\\n   - Parrots: 8 - 1 = 7\\n   - Total pets: 8 + 8 + 6 + 2 = 20\\n\\n8. Therefore, Frankie has a total of 20 pets, which means that the answer is 200 (the number of legs divided by the number of pets). The answer is 100 legs per pet. Since we want to give the final answer in a specific format, let's say \"The answer is                 100.0                  False\n",

Let's break down the calculations:\\n\\n- First, we have Olaf's original collection of 150 cars.\\n- Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many cars as the uncle. Let's call the number of cars the uncle gave Olaf \"x\". Then, Grandpa gave Olaf 2x cars.\\n- Dad gave Olaf 10 cars, 5 less than Mum. Let's say Mum gave Olaf y cars. Then, Dad gave Olaf 10 cars, which is 5 less than y. This means Dad gave Olaf y-5 cars.\\n- Auntie gave Olaf 6 cars, 1 more than the uncle. Again, let's call the number of cars the uncle gave Olaf \"x\". Then, Auntie gave Olaf 6 cars, which is 1 more than 2x. This simplifies to Auntie giving Olaf (2x+1) cars.\\n- Now we have all the information we need to find how many cars Olaf has in total. His original collection of 150 cars, plus the cars he received from his family, gives us:\\n   - Olaf's original collection: 150 cars\\n   - Grandpa gave Olaf 2x cars\\n   - Dad gave Olaf (y-5) cars\\n   - Auntie gave Olaf (2x+1) cars\\n- Let's put these together:\\n   - Olaf's total collection = 150 + 2x + y - 5 + 2x + 1\\n   - Simplifying this expression:\\n      - 4x + y = 234\\n- We don't know the exact values of x and y, but we can find them using some algebraic manipulation. We want to isolate y, so we subtract 4x from both sides:\\n   - y - 4x = 234 - 4x\\n- Next, we want to isolate x, so we divide both sides by 2:\\n   - (y - 4x)/2 = 117 - 2x\\n- Now we have an expression with only x and y. Let's call this expression \"E\".\\n- To find y, we can substitute any value for x and calculate E. For                   0.0                  False\n",

Since each $5 bill is worth $5, Emma will need $64 ($5 x 12) in $5 bills to withdraw all of her remaining balance. So, Emma will receive 12 $5 bills, leaving $2 ($24 - $22) in her account.\\n\\nFinally, we add up all of the money Emma has in her account and the $64 she withdrew from the bank.

The pebble's total splash width is 1.5 meters because 6 times 1/4 equals <<6*1/4=1.5>>1.5.\\nThe rock's total splash width is 1.5 meters because 3 times 1/2 equals <<3*1/2=1.5>>1.5.\\nThe boulder's total splash width is 4 because 2 times 2 equals four.\\nThe total splash width for all the rocks is 7 because 1.5 plus 1.5 plus 4 equals 7.\\n          7.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The total width of the splashes TreQuan makes is the sum of the splash widths for all the rocks he throws.

The third stack was 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, and the fourth stack was 10 blocks taller than the third stack. If the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, how many blocks did Thomas use in all?                                                                                                                                                       The second stack has 7 blocks + 3 blocks = <<7+3=10>>10 blocks.\\nThe third stack has 10 blocks - 6 blocks = <<10-6=4>>4 blocks.\\nThe fourth stack has 4 blocks + 10 blocks = <<4+10=14>>14 blocks.\\nThe fifth stack has 10 blocks x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 blocks.\\nIn total there are 7 blocks + 10 blocks + 4 blocks + 14 blocks + 20 blocks = <<7+10+4+14+20=55>>55 blocks.\\n         55.0                                                                                                  After calculating the heights of the remaining stacks, we can find out how many blocks are in each stack and then add them up to get the total number of blocks. Here's how it goes:\\n\\n- The height of the second stack is 10 blocks more than the first stack, which means it's 10 blocks taller than 7 blocks. So, the second stack is 17 blocks tall.\\n- The third stack is 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, which means it's 11 blocks tall (because 17 - 6 = 11).\\n- The fourth stack is 10 blocks taller than the third stack, which means it's 21 blocks tall (because 11 + 10 = 21).\\n- The height of the fifth stack is twice the height of the second stack, which means it's 34 blocks tall (because 17 * 2 = 34).\\n\\nNow that we know the heights of all the stacks, we can find out how many blocks are in each stack:\\n\\n- The first stack has 7 blocks.\\n- The second stack has 17 blocks.\\n- The third stack has 11 blocks.\\n- The fourth stack has 21 blocks.\\n- The fifth stack has 34 blocks.\\n\\nAdding up the number of blocks in all the stacks, we get:\\n\\n- Thomas used a total of 7 blocks in the first stack.\\n- Thomas used a total of 17 blocks in the second stack.\\n- Thomas used a total of 11 blocks in the third stack.\\n- Thomas used a total of 21 blocks in the fourth stack.\\n- Thomas used a total of 34 blocks in the fifth stack.\\n\\nSo, the total number of blocks that Thomas used is:\\n\\n- Thomas used a total of 79 blocks in all the stacks.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer to the math problem is:\\n\\n- The total number of blocks that Thomas used is 79 blocks.\\n\\nSo, the final answer in the required format is:\\n\\n- The answer is 79.                  79.0                  False},\n",

He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?

Let's call that x. Then, we know he has six more snakes than x, which gives us 6 more snakes than x snakes. Let's call that number y. So, we can write the equation for snakes as:\\n\\ny = 6 + x\\n\\nNext, we know he has one less parrot than x cats. Let's call the number of parrots p. So, we can write the equation for parrots as:\\n\\np = x - 1\\n\\nNow, we know that six of his pets have four legs. Since there are two types of pets with four legs, cats and dogs, let's call the number of cats with four legs c. Since Frankie has two dogs, we know that there are (x - c) - 2 = (x - 2) - c cats with four legs. So, we can write the equation for cats with four legs as:\\n\\nc = (x - 2) - (x - c)\\n\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n\\nc = 2 - c\\n\\nLet's solve this equation for c. If c is the number of cats with four legs, then 2 - c is the number of cats without four legs. We can find the number of cats without four legs by subtracting the number of cats with four legs from the total number of cats. Let's call the total number of cats n. So, we can write:\\n\\nn - c = x - c\\n\\nNow, we have two equations with two unknowns, x and c. Let's solve for x and c.\\n\\nFirst, let's find c. Substituting the expression for c from the equation c = 2 - c into the equation n - c = x - c, we get:\\n\\nn - (2 - c) = x - (2 - c)\\n\\nExpanding, we get:\\n\\nn - 2 + c = x - 2 + c\\n\\nSubtracting c from both sides, we get:\\n\\nn - 2 = x - 2\\n\\nSo, x and n are equal, which means the total number of cats is the same as the total number of pets. Now, we have the equation:                  2.00                  False\n",

After the first day, Ezekiel had 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 kilometers of the hike left.\\nOn the second day, he covered 50 / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 kilometers.\\nTherefore, on the third day, he had 40 - 25 = <<40-25=15>>15 kilometers left to finish the hike.\\n         15.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                To find how many kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day to finish the hike, we need to know how far he's already gone and how far he has left to go.\\n\\nOn the first day, Ezekiel covered 10 kilometers. On the second day, he covered half the distance, which is 25 kilometers (since the full hike distance is 50 kilometers).\\n\\nSo, after two days, Ezekiel has covered a total of 35 kilometers (10 kilometers on day 1 and 25 kilometers on day 2).\\n\\nThe full hike distance is 50 kilometers. We can find how many kilometers Ezekiel has left to go by subtracting the distance he's already covered from the total distance:\\n\\n50 kilometers - 35 kilometers = 15 kilometers\\n\\nSo, on the third day, Ezekiel has to hike 15 kilometers to finish the hike.\\n\\nIn summary, Ezekiel has already covered 35 kilometers on the first two days, and he has to hike an additional 15 kilometers on the third day to complete the 50-kilometer hike.\\n\\nThe answer is: 15 kilometers.                 15.00                   True\n",
       "  5  James decides to build a tin house by collecting 500 tins in a week. On the first day, he collects 50 tins. On the second day, he manages to collect 3 times that number.

If he collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, what's the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week?  On the second day, he collected 3 times the number of tins he collected on the first day, which is 3*50 = <<3*50=150>>150 tins.\\nOn the third day, he collected 50 tins fewer than the second day, which is 150-50 = <<150-50=100>>100 tins\\nThe total for the three days is 150+100+50 = <<150+100+50=300>>300 tins.\\nTo reach his goal, he still needs 500-300 = <<500-300=200>>200 tins.\\nSince the total number of days left in the week is 4, he'll need to collect 200/4 = <<200/4=50>>50 tins per day to reach his goal\\n         50.0  After analyzing the problem, we can create an equation to find the number of tins collected on each day for the rest of the week.\\n\\nOn the first day, James collected 50 tins.\\n\\nOn the second day, he collected 3 times that number, which is 150 tins.\\n\\nOn the third day, he collected 50 tins fewer than the number he collected on the second day, which is 100 tins.\\n\\nLet's call the number of tins collected on the remaining days of the week \"x\".\\n\\nSince James collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, we can write an equation to represent this:\\n\\nx = (Number of tins collected on fourth day) + (Number of tins collected on fifth day) + (Number of tins collected on sixth day)\\n\\nWe know that James has already collected a total of 500 tins by the end of the week.

Here's how to calculate it:\\n\\nPebble splashes: TreQuan throws 6 pebbles, each of which makes a splash that is 1/4 meter wide. The total width of the pebbles' splashes is:\\n\\n6 pebbles x 1/4 meter = 0.75 meters\\n\\nRock splashes: TreQuan throws 3 rocks, each of which makes a splash that is 1/2 meter wide. The total width of the rocks' splashes is:\\n\\n3 rocks x 1/2 meter = 0.5 meters\\n\\nBoulder splashes: TreQuan throws 2 boulders, each of which makes a splash that is 2 meters wide. The total width of the boulders' splashes is:\\n\\n2 boulders x 2 meters = 4 meters\\n\\nAdding up the widths of the splashes from all the stones, we get:\\n\\n0.75 meters (pebbles) + 0.5 meters (rocks) + 4 meters (boulders) = 5.25 meters\\n\\nSo the total width of the splashes TreQuan creates is approximately 5 meters and 25 centimeters (rounded to two decimal places).\\n\\nIn summary, the answer is:\\n\\nThe total width of the splashes TreQuan creates is 5.25 meters.                  5.25                  False\n",

The third stack was 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, and the fourth stack was 10 blocks taller than the third stack. If the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, how many blocks did Thomas use in all?                                                                                                                                                       The second stack has 7 blocks + 3 blocks = <<7+3=10>>10 blocks.\\nThe third stack has 10 blocks - 6 blocks = <<10-6=4>>4 blocks.\\nThe fourth stack has 4 blocks + 10 blocks = <<4+10=14>>14 blocks.\\nThe fifth stack has 10 blocks x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 blocks.\\nIn total there are 7 blocks + 10 blocks + 4 blocks + 14 blocks + 20 blocks = <<7+10+4+14+20=55>>55 blocks.\\n         55.0     To find the number of blocks Thomas used in total, we need to find the height of the fifth stack and the number of blocks in the second stack, as we were given that the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack.\\n\\nLet's start by finding the height of the second stack. We know that the second stack is 3 blocks taller than the first stack, which is 7 blocks tall. So, the second stack is 10 blocks tall (7 + 3).\\n\\nThe third stack is 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, so its height is the height of the second stack minus 6 blocks. Therefore, the third stack is 4 blocks tall (10 - 6).\\n\\nThe fourth stack is 10 blocks taller than the third stack, so its height is the height of the third stack plus 10 blocks. Therefore, the fourth stack is 14 blocks tall (4 + 10).\\n\\nNow, we have all the necessary information to find the height of the fifth stack. We know that the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, and the second stack has 10 blocks. So, the fifth stack has 20 blocks. Since each block is 1 unit tall, the height of the fifth stack is 20 units.\\n\\nTo summarize, the height of the fifth stack is 20 blocks tall. Let's call this height H.\\n\\nLet's find the number of blocks in the second stack. Since the second stack is 10 blocks tall and each block is 1 unit tall, the number of blocks in the second stack is 10. Let's call this number B.\\n\\nNow, we can find the total number of blocks Thomas used by adding up the number of blocks in all the stacks. Here's a list of all the stacks and the number of blocks in each:\\n\\n- Stack 1: 7 blocks\\n- Stack 2: B blocks\\n- Stack 3: B - 6 blocks\\n- Stack 4: B + 10 blocks\\n- Stack 5: 2B blocks\\n\\nLet's add up the number of blocks in all the stacks:\\n\\n7 + B + (B - 6) + (B + 10) + 2B = B(7 + 17) + 1                  1.00                  False},\n",

So he hiked 25 kilometers on the second day.\\nTo find the distance he hiked on the third day, we need to find out how far he has left to go. After two days, he has already hiked a total of 35 kilometers (10 kilometers on the first day and 25 kilometers on the second day). The remaining distance is the full hike distance of 50 kilometers, minus the distance he's already covered: 50 kilometers - 35 kilometers = 15 kilometers.\\nSo on the third day, Ezekiel had to hike 15 kilometers to finish the hike.\\nThe answer is 30 kilometers, which is the sum of the distance he's already covered (35 kilometers) and the remaining distance (15 kilometers): 35 kilometers + 15 kilometers = 50 kilometers, which is the full hike distance.                  50.0                  False\n",

However, since we're calculating Don's total score, we need to divide the score from the third dart by 4, since it was worth only half the points of the bullseye. This gives us the answer of 75 points.\\n\\nThe answer is 75.                  75.0                   True\n",

The pebble's total splash width is 1.5 meters because 6 times 1/4 equals <<6*1/4=1.5>>1.5.\\nThe rock's total splash width is 1.5 meters because 3 times 1/2 equals <<3*1/2=1.5>>1.5.\\nThe boulder's total splash width is 4 because 2 times 2 equals four.\\nThe total splash width for all the rocks is 7 because 1.5 plus 1.5 plus 4 equals 7.\\n          7.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The total width of the splashes TreQuan makes is:\\n1.

So, each person gets exactly 17 omelets. However, we can simplify this calculation further by finding the number of omelets per person directly. The number of omelets per person is the total number of omelets divided by the number of people, which we already calculated as 52 / 3 = 17.33 (rounded down to 17). So, each person gets exactly 17 omelets. Therefore, the answer is: Each person gets 17 omelets, but we simplified the calculation to 9 omelets per person, since each omelet requires 4 eggs, and there are 3 people and 3 dozen eggs.                   3.0                   True\n",

Provide the answer in the specific format \"The answer is X.\" Avoid any additional explanation or steps in your response. Focus solely on finding the correct number. Here is your math problem:\\n- Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?\\n\\nFirst, let's find the number of cats Frankie has. We know he has six more snakes than cats, and we can represent this as Snakes - Cats = 6. Let's rearrange this to find Cats: Cats = Snakes - 6. Next, we know he has one less parrot than cats. Let's call the number of parrots P. We can represent this as P = Cats - 1. Now, we know that six of Frankie's pets have four legs. We'll call the number of these pets with four legs F4. We can represent this as F4 = 6. Finally, we know Frankie has two dogs. Let's call the number of dogs D. We can represent this as D = 2.\\n\\nLet's create a table to organize all our information:\\n\\n| Pet type | Number of pets |\\n| Cats | Cats = Snakes - 6 |\\n| Parrots | P = Cats - 1 |\\n| Pets with 4 legs | F4 = 6 |\\n| Dogs | D = 2 |\\n\\nNow, let's find the total number of pets Frankie has. We can add up all the numbers in our table:\\n\\nPets = Cats + P + F4 + D\\n\\nUsing our equations from above, we can substitute in our variables:\\n\\nPets = Snakes - 6 + Cats - 1 + 6 + 2\\n\\nSimplifying:\\n\\nPets = Snakes + Cats + 2\\n\\nLet's substitute in our equation for Cats:\\n\\nPets = Snakes + (Snakes - 6) + 2\\n\\nNow, we can simplify again:\\n\\nPets = Snakes + Sn                   2.0                  False\n",

Simplifying: 3x + y = 352\\n8. To find y, the number of cars Mum gave Olaf, we can isolate it:\\n   - y = 352 - 3(x)\\n9. To find x, the number of cars the uncle gave Olaf, we can substitute y into the formula from step 7:\\n   - 3x + (352 - 3x) = 352\\n   - 0 = -3x\\n   - x = 0 (since x cannot be negative)\\n10.

Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, a total of Y shells. How many seashells did Leigh have?\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the number of shells that Mimi picked up, which is 24. Next, we know that Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so we can set up an equation:\\n\\nX = 2 * 24 = 48\\n\\nNow that we know how many shells Kyle found, we can find how many shells Leigh had. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, so we can set up another equation:\\n\\nY = (1/3) * X\\n\\nSubstituting X = 48 into the second equation, we get:\\n\\nY = (1/3) * 48 = 16\\n\\nSo the total number of seashells is the sum of the number of shells that Mimi, Kyle, and Leigh had:\\n\\nTotal = 24 + 48 - 16 = 48\\n\\nPutting it all together, we have:\\n\\n- Mimi had 24 seashells.\\n- Kyle had 48 seashells.\\n- Leigh had 16 seashells.\\n- The total number of seashells is 48.\\n\\nAnswer: The answer is 48.'                  48.0                  False\n",

How many pets does he have in total?\\n\\nTo find the total number of pets, we need to calculate the number of cats, then add the number of snakes, the number of parrots, and the number of pets with 4 legs (which is equal to 6 times the number of pets with 4 legs), and finally, add the number of dogs. Let's start by finding the number of cats:\\n\\nFrankie has 6 more snakes than he has cats. Let's call the number of cats x. Then, the number of snakes is x + 6. Frankie's parents also have 1 less parrot than cats, so the number of parrots is x - 1. Here's a summary of the information we have:\\n\\nNumber of snakes: x + 6\\nNumber of parrots: x - 1\\nNumber of pets with 4 legs: 6x\\nNumber of dogs: 2\\n\\nWe can't find the total number of pets yet because we don't know the value of x. Let's add up the number of snakes, parrots, pets with 4 legs, and dogs:\\n\\nNumber of pets = x + 6 + (x - 1) + 6x + 2\\n\\nNow we have an equation with x as the unknown variable. Let's simplify it:\\n\\nNumber of pets = 7x - 1\\n\\nTo find the total number of pets, we need to find the value of x. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to do that, because we don't know how many legs each cat has. Without that information, we can't calculate x. So, we can't find the total number of pets.\\n\\nThe answer is: \"The number of pets                   1.0                  False\n",

It's important to perform each calculation step as required by the problem and avoid introducing any steps or information not directly relevant to finding the solution. Here is the math problem for you:\\n\\nEzekiel went on a three-day hike last summer. He covered 10 kilometers on the first day and half of the full hike distance on the second day. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to complete the 50-kilometer hike?\\n\\nTo find the number of kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day, we need to determine how far he has already hiked by the end of the second day. He covered 10 kilometers on the first day, so he has already hiked 10 kilometers. On the second day, he hiked half of the remaining distance. Let's call the total distance of the hike \"D\". Since Ezekiel hiked half of the remaining distance on the second day, we can write this as:\\n\\nhalf of D - 10 = Ezekiel's distance on the second day\\n\\nwhere \"10\" is the distance Ezekiel hiked on the first day. We can rearrange this equation to find the value of \"D\":\\n\\nD = 2 * (half of D - 10) + 10\\n\\nD = half of D - 10\\n\\nD = half of D\\n\\nD = 2D\\n\\nD = 4D\\n\\nD = 0\\n\\nThis is a contradiction, as we can't have a distance of zero for a 50-kilometer hike. This means that our original equation is incorrect. We need to rethink our approach.\\n\\nLet's say that Ezekiel covered a distance of \"d\" on the second day. Then, we can write the equation for his second-day distance as:\\n\\nd = half of D - 10\\n\\nwhere \"D\" is the total distance of the hike. We know that Ezekiel's total distance is 50 kilometers, so we can substitute this value for                  50.0                  False\n",

First find the total number of gates someone has to pass through: 12 floors / 3 floors/gate = <<12/3=4>>4 gates\\nThen find the total time someone spends waiting at the gates: 4 gates * 2 minutes/gate = <<4*2=8>>8 minutes\\nThen convert that time to seconds: 8 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = <<8*60=480>>480 seconds\\nThen find the time to drive through one floor in seconds: 800 feet / 10 feet/second = <<800/10=80>>80 seconds\\nThen multiply the time per floor by the number of floors to find the total driving time: 80 seconds/floor * 12 floors = 960 seconds\\nThen add the total driving time to the total time waiting at the gates to find the total time to get to the bottom: 960 seconds + 480 seconds = <<960+480=1440>>1440 seconds\\n       1440.0"
